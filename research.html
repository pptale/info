                  it. In this work, we consider two problems

                  the context of exact exponential-time algorithms
                  and parameterized complexity. (1) Given a graph
                  G on n vertices, find its cd-chromatic
                  number. (2) Given a graph G and integers k and
                  q, can we delete at most k vertices such that
                  the cd-chromatic number of the resulting graph

                  there is a subset X of E(G), such that G/X is
                  isomorphic to H. Here, G/X is the graph obtained
                  from G by contracting all the edges in X.  For a
                  family of graphs FF, the FF-Contraction problem
                  takes as input a graph G on n vertices, and the
                  objective is to output the largest integer t,
                  such that G is contractible to a graph H in FF,
                  where |V (H)| = t. When FF is the family of
                  paths, then the corresponding F-Contraction
                  problem is called Path Contraction. The problem
                  Path Contraction admits a simple algorithm
                  running in time 2^n poly(n). In spite of the
                  deceptive simplicity of the problem, beating the
                  2^n bound for Path Contraction seems quite
                  challenging. In this paper, we design an exact
                  exponential time algorithm for Path Contraction that runs in time 1.99987^n poly(n).

                  vertices, and an integer k. The task is to

                  intersect all cycles which pass through the

                <td>We study the parameterized complexity of various
                  graph theoretic problems in the dynamic framework
                  where the input graph is being updated by a sequence
                  of edge additions and deletions. The goal in the area
                  of dynamic graph algorithms is to efficiently
                  maintain a solution under these changes. Recomputing
                  a new solution on the new graph is an expensive task
                  especially when the number of modifications made to
                  the graph is significantly smaller than the size of
                  the graph. In the context of parameterized
                  algorithms, two natural parameters are the size k of
                  the symmetric difference of the edge sets of the two
                  graphs (on n vertices) and the size r of the
                  symmetric difference of the two solutions. We study
                  the Dynamic \Pi-Deletion problem which is the dynamic
                  variant of the classical \Pi-Deletion problem and
                  show NP-hardness, fixed-parameter tractability and
                  kernelization results.</td>
