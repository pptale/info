                  there is a subset X of E(G), such that G/X is
                  isomorphic to H. Here, G/X is the graph obtained
                  from G by contracting all the edges in X.  For a
                  family of graphs FF, the FF-Contraction problem
                  takes as input a graph G on n vertices, and the
                  objective is to output the largest integer t,
                  such that G is contractible to a graph H in FF,
                  where |V (H)| = t. When FF is the family of
                  paths, then the corresponding F-Contraction
                  problem is called Path Contraction. The problem
                  Path Contraction admits a simple algorithm
                  running in time 2^n poly(n). In spite of the
                  deceptive simplicity of the problem, beating the
                  2^n bound for Path Contraction seems quite
                  challenging. In this paper, we design an exact
                  exponential time algorithm for Path Contraction that
                  runs in time 1.99987^n poly(n).

                  (Subset-FVS) problem the input is a graph G, a
                  subset T of vertices of G called the “terminal”
                  vertices, and an integer k. The task is to
                  determine whether there exists a subset of
                  vertices of cardinality at most k which together
                  intersect all cycles which pass through the
                  terminals. Subset-FVS generalizes several well
                  studied problems including Feedback Vertex Set,
                  and Multiway Cut. This problem is known to be
                  NP-Complete even in split graphs. In this work
                  we improve kernelization, fixed parameter
                  tractable, and exact algorithms for Subset-FVS
                  on Split graph. Our algorithm works even for
		  chordal graphs. </td>

                  graph theoretic problems in the dynamic framework
                  where the input graph is being updated by a sequence
                  of edge additions and deletions. The goal in the area
                  of dynamic graph algorithms is to efficiently
                  maintain a solution under these changes. Recomputing
                  a new solution on the new graph is an expensive task
                  especially when the number of modifications made to
                  the graph is significantly smaller than the size of
                  the graph. In the context of parameterized
                  algorithms, two natural parameters are the size k of
                  the symmetric difference of the edge sets of the two
                  graphs (on n vertices) and the size r of the

		  However, most times, we can exploit planarity
		  to get improved algorithms compared to what is possible for general graphs.
		  While there are specific algorithmic ideas, like
		  ‘bidimensionality’, which were used multiple times
		  to get such improvements,
		  the algorithms we get are highly
		  problem-specific, and they do not give a general understanding of why such improvement

		  The main contribution of our project is formulating a family

		  on planar graphs. Our approach can handle problems that were not amendable to known

                <td> In (k, i)-coloring, every vertex is assigned a
                set of k colors so that adjacent vertices share at
                most i colors between them. It is clear that (1,
                0)-coloring is equivalent to the classical graph
                coloring problem. We extend the study of exact and
                parameterized algorithms for classical graph coloring
                  problem to (k, i)-coloring of graphs.

                <td> In the lossy kernelization framework, for a
                constant \alpha, given an instance (I, k) we obtain an
                instance (I', k') of the same problem such that, for
                every c > 1, any c-approximate solution to (I', k')
                can be turned into a (c \alpha)-approximate solution
                to the original instance (I, k) in polynomial time. In
                this work, we design a polynomial size approximate
                kernelization scheme (PSAKS) for Tree Contraction,
                Star Contraction, Out-Tree Contraction and Cactus
                Contraction problems. These problems do not admit
                polynomial kernels, and we show that each of them
                admit a PSAKS.

                <td>  In this thesis, we explore FF-CONTRACTION for
                various graph classes from the viewpoints of
                parameterized complexity, lossy kernelization and
                exact algorithms. We extend the known boundaries about
                graph contraction problems in several ways. We
                consider FF-CONTRACTION problems which do not have
                polynomial kernels when parameterized by solution
                size. We compliment this negative result in two
                ways. Firstly, we present a polynomial kernel when
                parameterized by solution size and an additional
                parameter. In other words, we identify new graph
                classes for which there is a polynomial kernel. We
                also prove that these kernels are optimal under
                a certain complexity conjecture. Secondly, we present a
                lossy kernel of polynomial size for all these
                problems. We present two FPT algorithms to append the
                list of graph classes FF for which FF-CONTRACTION
                parameterized by solution size is FPT. We end this
                thesis with a non-trivial exact algorithm to determine
                what is the largest size of graph in a specific F to
                  which an input graph can be contracted.
